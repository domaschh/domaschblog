# Introduction

"Turbo 8 is dropping TypeScript" [^1]. The recent decision by David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH), the Ruby on Rails founder, to completely remove TypeScript from Turbo, a popular JavaScript framework, has reignited the heated debate about strongly typed vs weakly typed languages in the programming community.

Meanwhile, the recent launch of Mojo-lang, a new Python-like programming language that conversely bets on the power of strong typing, and the general popularity increase of languages like Rust [^2] shows that there is no clear path and that opinions about the usefulness of strong type checking in programming languages differ greatly.

Both the premise of perceived developer efficiency through weak typing and program safety through strong typing gain increasingly more traction online and promise to be the "right" paradigm.

The objective of this paper is to first introduce the concept of both weak and strong type checking and then build a better understanding of the motivations and resulting implications behind the choice of paradigm and potentially find a middle ground that results in both a safe and productive programming experience.
